Triton Treasure Map is a Triton's guide to UCSD! With three key quizzes- Study spots, weekend activities, and food preferences- any student can make the most of their time on campus. Each quiz takes in your preferences to output a personalized recommendation. When people enter a college campus for the first time, in a new city, it is often difficult to find places that suits them, whether it be on campus or off campus. Luckily, we have the beauty of San Diego and the abundance of resources at UCSD in order to enhance a student's experience.
